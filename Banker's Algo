/* Write a Multithread Program that implements the Banker's Algorithm. Create n threads that request and release resources from the bank.
The Banker will grant the request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. It is important that shared data be in safe from 
concurrent access. To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use Mutex locks.*/
